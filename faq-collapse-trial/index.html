          <h3 class="faq-text">What is cryptocurrency?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to
          counterfeit or double-spend. Many cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on blockchain technology—a
          distributed ledger enforced by a disparate network of computers.</p>

          <h3 class="faq-text">Heat vs temperature?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Heat and temperature are a closely related topic, and as such, the difference between the two can be a bit confusing.
          The core difference is that heat deals with thermal energy, whereas temperature is more concerned with molecular kinetic
          energy..</p>

          <h3 class="faq-text">What is Entropy?</h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">Entropy, the measure of a system’s thermal energy per unit temperature that is unavailable for doing useful work.
          Because work is obtained from ordered molecular motion, the amount of entropy is also a measure of the molecular
          disorder, or randomness, of a system. The concept of entropy provides deep insight into the direction of spontaneous
          change for many everyday phenomena. Its introduction by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius in 1850 is a highlight of
          19th-century physics.</p>
